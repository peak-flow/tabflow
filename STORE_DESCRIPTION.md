## Permission Justifications

**tabs**: Required to read tab information (titles, URLs, favicons), move tabs between windows, and manage tab operations. This is core to the extension's functionality.

**storage**: Used to save user preferences locally (view modes, layout settings) so they persist between sessions. No data is sent to external servers.
